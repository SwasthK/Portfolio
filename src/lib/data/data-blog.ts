Posts are typically displayed in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_chronology">reverse chronological order</a> so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">web page</a>. In the 2000s, blogs were often the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, multi-author blogs (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author">authors</a> and sometimes professionally <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing">edited</a>. MABs from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper">newspapers</a>, other <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media">media outlets</a>, universities, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank">think tanks</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group">advocacy groups</a>, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_traffic">traffic</a>. The rise of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> and other "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">microblogging</a>" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media">news media</a>. <em>Blog</em> can also be used as a verb, meaning <em>to maintain or add content to a blog</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">computer programming</a>. Previously, knowledge of such technologies as HTML and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">File Transfer Protocol</a> had been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hackers</a> and computer enthusiasts. As of the 2010s, the majority are interactive <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-2">[2]</a> In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service">social networking service</a>. Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-3">[3]</a> Blog owners or authors often <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum#Moderators">moderate</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordfilter">filter</a> online comments to remove <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech">hate speech</a> or other offensive content. There are also high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.</p><p><br></p><p>Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">philosophy</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">religion</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art">arts</a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics">politics</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport">sports</a>. Others function as more personal <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_diary">online diaries</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising">online brand advertising</a> of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image">digital images</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">links</a> to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_blog"><em>art blogs</em></a>), photographs (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoblog"><em>photoblogs</em></a>), videos (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_blog"><em>video blogs</em></a> or <em>vlogs</em>), music (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3_blog"><em>MP3 blogs</em></a>), and audio (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast"><em>podcasts</em></a>). In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edublog"><em>edublogs</em></a>. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">Microblogging</a> is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Blog</em> and <em>blogging</em> are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">social media</a>, especially when the content is long-form and one creates and shares content on a regular basis, so one could be maintaining a blog on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> or blogging on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram">Instagram</a>.
